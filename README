This was intended to be a Flask powered website where users could upload
Packet Capture files, extract useful/interesting information,
and comment on their findings. It could be useful for distance education
networking classes.

Code exists to extract data from PCap files, including individual tcp
streams. A PCap file can be browsed on the web using a very simple html
interface.

The following libraries are used:
dpkt 1.7
flowgrep 0.9
libnids 1.24
pylibcap 0.6.2
pynids 0.6.1
